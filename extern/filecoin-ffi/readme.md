# `filecoin-ffi` version

For the backward compatibility of the tool, `lotus-box` does not specify the version of `filecoin-ffi` used, and `filecoin-ffi` in lotus is used instead. 
Therefore, users have to compile a copy of the latest (available) `lotus` in the same level directory of `lotus-box`. 
I think it is worth it.
